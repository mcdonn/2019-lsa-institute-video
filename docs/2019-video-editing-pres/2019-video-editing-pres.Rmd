<!--

- Containers
  - Contain all information about a video file: video, audio, metadata
  - Popular containers: MPEG-4 (.mp4), AVCHD (.mts), QTFF (.mov)

- Codecs
  - Way to compress or decompress (code or decode) data
  - Data is compressed for storage and decompressed when a video is played
  - Popular codecs: H.264 (for .mp4 files), MPEG-2 (for .mts files) ProRes (Apple proprietary)


- Lossless vs. lossy

  - Lossless: a method of data encoding that allows the original data to be completely reconstructed upon decompression
    - Lossless audio codecs: .wav, .aiff
  - Lossy: a method of data encoding that only saves the essential information in order to reduce file size
    - Lossy audio codecs: .mp3, .aac

# Video editing in language documentation

- Why do we need to edit videos?
  
  - To create archive-ready video into a single high-quality file
  
  - To export videos into accessible and/or shareable file types
  
  - To sync video and audio that were created using a dual system method

- There is no established workflow for video
 
  - But some archives have created methods (see especially [ELAR](https://www.soas.ac.uk/elar/helpsheets/))

- There is no all-encompasing free open-source video editing software (e.g., Audacity for video)

# What is Adobe Premiere?

- A non-linear video editing system

  - Acts as a middle man between the original and edited files

- It does not alter the original file
   
- Many, many video professionals use Adobe Premiere

# Workflow

1. Upload files (audio and video)
  - For AVCHD video, upload the highest level folder (usually named "PRIVATE") 
  - ... and ***don't*** rename the file! 
  - simply place it in a folder that is properly named

1. Align audio and video (in Premiere)
  
1. Trim files (in Premiere)

1. Choose export settings (in Premiere)

1. Export (in Media Encoder)

# (Free) video editing software
- [Hitfilm](https://fxhome.com/express)
  - Confusing download
- [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/download/)
  - No way to align audio and video (must do it manually)
- [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_lwks&view=download&Itemid=206)
  - Not intuitive.  
  - Can’t export to high-quality formats (highest is 720)
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) <- personal favorite!
  - Super slow export
  - Not intuitive
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) (file conversion software)
  - Only converts to .mkv and .mp4
