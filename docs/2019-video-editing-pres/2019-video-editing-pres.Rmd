# Video-editing in language documentation

- Why do we need to edit videos?
  
  - To combine audio and video into a single high-quality file
  
  - To export videos into accessible, long-lasting, and/or shareable file types

- There is no established workflow for video

- There is no all-encompasing free open-source video editing software (e.g., Audacity for video)

# What is Adobe Premiere?

- Adobe specializes in creative software (i.e. Photoshop)

- Nearly all video professionals use Adobe

- A non-linear video editing system

- Acts as a middle man between the original and edited files

- It does not alter the original file

# Key terms
- Containers
  - Contain all information about a video file: video, audio, metadata
  - Popular containers: MPEG-4 (.mp4), AVCHD (.mts), QTFF (.mov)

- Codecs

--
  - Way to compress or decompress (code or decode) data
  - Data is compressed for storage and decompressed when a video is played
  - Popular codecs: H.264 (for .mp4 files), MPEG-2 (for .mts files) ProRes (Apple proprietary)
  
--

- Lossless vs. lossy

--

  - Lossless: a method of data encoding that allows the original data to be completely reconstructed upon decompression
    - Lossless audio codecs: .wav, .aiff
  - Lossy: a method of data encoding that only saves the essential information in order to reduce file size
    - Lossy audio codecs: .mp3, .aac

# Adobe Practice


???
Here's where we'll just lead them through editing a file (leaning towards editing the file together rather than just sending them off on their own. I may change my mind after our first session) and asking them to export several types: high quality video, low quality shareable video, and just audio. Will give some explanation on the different parts of the editing window and such

# Free Video editing software
- [Hitfilm](https://fxhome.com/express)
  - Confusing download
- [Openshot](https://www.openshot.org/download/)
  - No way to align audio an video (must do it manually)
- [Lightworks](https://www.lwks.com/index.php?option=com_lwks&view=download&Itemid=206)
  - Not intuitive.  
  - Can’t export to high-quality formats (highest is 720)
- [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) <- personal favorite!
  - Super slow export
  - Not intuitive
- [Final Cut Pro](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12) (only for Macs)
  - As powerful as Premiere if you have $300
- [Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) (file conversion software)
  - Only converts to .mkv and .mp4
