# Why video?


.pull-left[
**When there are so many downsides...**

- It could be distracting for participants...
  - much more distracting than a discrete audio recorder
  - resulting in 'unnatural' data
- It's more expensive than audio equipment 
- The file sizes are *sooo* much larger
  - and difficult to edit, process, archive, etc.
- ...

**There are upsides too...**
- For sign languages, it's really the *only* realistic way to record the language in use
- Context, context, context 
- Records important information
  - gesture
  - eye gaze
  - facial expression
- Potentially more interesting resource for language community
- More suited to internet/popular culture

# Video basics


---

# Positioning the camera

- There are not necessarily hard and fast rules about where one ought to position the camera
- It is possible though to get a worse recording based upon the camera's position

### The camera should be above participants and angled slightly downwards

### Difficult to record multiple people's facial expressions & eye gaze

---

# Framing

### Documentary linguists want wide shots from a stationary tripod
  - No handheld shots
  - No close ups 
  - No zooming or panning

### Documentary linguists want wide shots from a stationary tripod

---

# Framing

### Capture as much of the participants' body as possible 
  - especially from the waist up

--

### Ensure that participants fit inside the frame when their arms are stretched out in any direction
  - to ensure that the video captures all gestures

---

# Framing

### Don't react... anticipate
  - anticipate where participants might move, etc.

---

# Framing

### There are of course reasons to position the camera differently: 

Check out this [sand story](https://elar.soas.ac.uk/Record/MPI1091525).

---

# Lighting

### Lighting can be very tricky.

 - **documentary linguists rarely if ever use professional lighting,**
 - **typically rely on *practical light***. 

--

### Here are some basic tips...

---

# Lighting

### Careful to position any windows or other natural light source behind you...
  - and not behind your participants. 

---

# Lighting

### Brighter does not always mean better
  - pay attention to your participants face (and especially their eyes)
    - light coming from directly above can create shadows that obscure their face. 
      - you may lose important information about eye gaze!
    - the same is true of the sun, 
      - it's best to video in the late afternoon or better yet on an overcast day

---

# Lighting

### Make use the resources around you
  - Use lamps, laterns, and flashlights to help in dark setting
  - Certain cameras are better suited for low light
    - "Large sensor camcorders" (1" CMOS Sensor)

---

# Sound

### Sound is of utmost importance for spoken language

### Spoken language should use 'double system shooting'
  - record with a video camera *and* a separate audio recorder w/ microphone
    - audio/video synced in post-production
    - Slate the recordings by clapping in the frame of the camera
    - I do this at the beginning and end of the recording
  - video camera should be outfitted with shotgun microphone

# Sound advice

### Start simple and build upon your experiences

---

# What (kind of) camera should I purchase?

### Prosumer camcorders are probably best ($500 - $1,500)

### Check out [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/).

---

# What about DSLR cameras...

### Unforunately, they only record short periods of time & overhead easily
  - Granting organizations in the know won't buy them
